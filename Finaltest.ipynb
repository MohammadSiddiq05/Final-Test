    "# Question 2: Library Management System using Python OOP\n",
    "# Problem Statement:\n",
    "# Create a simplified Library Management System with Python classes that\n",
    "# represent a Library, Books, and Users. Your goal is to design the system so that\n",
    "# it enables basic functionalities, including adding and managing books,\n",
    "# registering users, and borrowing/returning books.\n",
    "# Instructions:\n",
    "# 1. Create a base class named Book:\n",
    "# o Attributes:\n",
    "# ▪ title (string): The title of the book.\n",
    "# ▪ author (string): The author of the book.\n",
    "# ▪ isbn (string): A unique identifier for each book.\n",
    "# ▪ is_borrowed (boolean): Indicates if the book is currently\n",
    "# borrowed.\n",
    "# o Methods:\n",
    "# ▪ borrow(): Sets the is_borrowed attribute to True.\n",
    "# ▪ return_book(): Sets the is_borrowed attribute to False.\n",
    "# 2. Create a subclass named DigitalBook that inherits from Book:\n",
    "# o Additional Attributes:\n",
    "# ▪ file_format (string): Format of the digital book (e.g., PDF,\n",
    "# EPUB).\n",
    "# o Override the borrow() method to print an additional message\n",
    "# indicating that the book can be accessed online.\n",
    "# 3. Create another subclass named AudioBook that inherits from Book:\n",
    "# o Additional Attributes:\n",
    "# ▪ duration (float): The length of the audiobook in hours.\n",
    "# o Override the borrow() method to print an additional message\n",
    "# indicating that the audiobook is available for streaming.\n",
    "# 4. Create a class named User:\n",
    "# o Attributes:\n",
    "# ▪ user_id (string): A unique identifier for each user.\n",
    "# ▪ name (string): The user’s name.\n",
    "# ▪ borrowed_books (list): A list of Book objects borrowed by\n",
    "# the user.\n",
    "# o Methods:\n",
    "# ▪ borrow_book(book): Adds a book to borrowed_books if it is\n",
    "# not already borrowed. Use encapsulation to ensure users\n",
    "# cannot modify borrowed_books directly.\n",
    "# ▪ return_book(book): Removes the book from\n",
    "# borrowed_books and marks it as returned.\n",
    "# 5. Create a class named Library:\n",
    "# o Attributes:\n",
    "# ▪ name (string): Name of the library.\n",
    "# ▪ books (list): A list of all Book objects in the library.\n",
    "# ▪ users (list): A list of all registered User objects.\n",
    "# o Methods:\n",
    "# ▪ add_book(book): Adds a new book to the library.\n",
    "# ▪ register_user(user): Registers a new user.\n",
    "# ▪ lend_book(user_id, isbn): Allows a user to borrow a book if\n",
    "# available.\n",
    "# ▪ receive_return(user_id, isbn): Allows a user to return a\n",
    "# borrowed book.\n",
    "# Requirements:\n",
    "# • Inheritance should be evident in the DigitalBook and AudioBook\n",
    "# subclasses that inherit from the Book base class.\n",
    "# • Polymorphism should be demonstrated in the overridden borrow()\n",
    "# methods of DigitalBook and AudioBook.\n",
    "# • Encapsulation should be used in the User class to prevent direct\n",
    "# modification of the borrowed_books attribute from outside the class.\n",
    "# Submission:\n",
    "# Submit your Python script containing all the classes (Book, DigitalBook,\n",
    "# AudioBook, User, and Library) along with test cases demonstrating the\n",
    "# following scenarios:\n",
    "# 1. Adding books and users to the library.\n",
    "# 2. Users borrowing and returning both digital and physical books.\n",
    "# 3. Handling cases where users try to borrow books that are already\n",
    "# borrowed.\n",
    "# Additional Notes:\n",
    "# • Document your code, explaining each class and method.\n",
    "# • Use error handling to manage potential issues, such as borrowing a\n",
    "# book that's unavailable.\n",
    "# • Test the system by creating instances of DigitalBook and AudioBook,\n",
    "# and by simulating\n",
